        <h2>Story of the Week</h2>
        <p>The biblical story of Abraham, found in the Book of Genesis, is foundational to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Abraham, originally named Abram, is considered the patriarch of these faiths. Abraham's story is one of faith, obedience, and the covenant between God and his chosen people. He is revered as a model of faith in monotheistic traditions.</p>

        <div id="client1">
            <p>"Working with Heavenly Hands Christian Counseling has truly been a transformative experience for me. When I first reached out for counseling, I was struggling with overwhelming anxiety and a sense of hopelessness. However, from the moment I stepped into their office, I felt a sense of warmth and acceptance that immediately put me at ease. My counselor listened with empathy and understanding, 
            providing me with practical tools and biblical insights to navigate through my challenges. Through our sessions, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself, 
            found healing from past wounds, and discovered a renewed sense of faith and purpose. I am incredibly grateful for the support and guidance I have received from Heavenly Hands Christian Counseling, 
            and I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking compassionate and faith-based counseling."</p>
